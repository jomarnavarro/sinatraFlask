# ISDB - CS50 Final Project

## About

ISDB is your trustworthy Internet Songs Data base.  It's based upon Songs by Sinatra, a "... website all 
about the songs of the Great Frank Sinatra".  This is a site that I frequently use in my workshop "Software Test 
Automation with Selenium WebDriver".  I have found this website to become buggy over the years and so I decided
to reimplement it to fix said defects and continue to support it as my personal teaching tool.

## Main Site Capabilities

The enhanced site has the following features:

 * Display a list of Songs, not just by Sinatra, but by any other artist out there.
 * Create new songs, once logged in.
 * Edit these songs,
 * Delete them.
 * Register a regular user
 * As an Admin, register both regular and Admin users.
 * Contact the admin
 
 ## Technology
 
 The site is built with Python Flask, CSS and Bootstrap on the front end, that communicates to a sqlite3 DB on 
 the backend.
